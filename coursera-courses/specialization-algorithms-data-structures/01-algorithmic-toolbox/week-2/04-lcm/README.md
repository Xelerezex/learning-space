## Least Common Multiple

### Least Common Multiple Problem
*Compute the least common multiple of two posi-
tive integers*

-   **Input:**  Two positive integers.

-   **Output:** Their least common multiple.

The least common multiple **LCM(a, b)** of two positive integers **a** and **b**
is the smallest integer **m** that is divisible by both **a** and **b**.

>   **Stop and Think. How LCM(a, b) is related to GCD(a, b)?**

#### Input format.
Integers *a* and *b* (separated by a space).

#### Output format.
*LCM(a, b).*

#### Constraints.
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?1&space;\leq&space;a,b&space;\leq&space;2&space;\cdot&space;10^{9}" title="1 \leq a,b \leq 2 \cdot 10^{9}" />

#### Sample 1.

**Input:**

```commandline
6 8
```

**Output:**

```commandline
24
```
Among all positive integers that are divisible by both 6 and 8 (e.g., 48, 480, 24), 24 is the smallest one.

#### Sample 2.

**Input:**

```commandline
28851538 1183019
```

**Output:**

```commandline
1933053046
```

1 933 053 046 is the smallest positive integer divisible by both
28 851 538 and 1 183 019.

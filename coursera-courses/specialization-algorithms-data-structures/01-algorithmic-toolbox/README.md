# Algorithmic Toolbox

### About:
The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications:
sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory:
how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively;
when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving
computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).

## Greedy Algorithms

### About:
In this module you will learn about seemingly na√Øve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges.

### Goals:
-    Practice implementing greedy solutions
-    Build greedy algorithms
-    Create a program for changing money optimally
-    Create a program for maximizing the value of a loot
-    Create a program for maximizing the number of prize places in a competition

## Assignment 1: Sum of Two Digits

### Sum of Two Digits Problem
*Compute the sum of two single digit numbers.*

-    **Input :** Two single digit numbers.
-    **Output:** The sum of these numbers.


We start from this ridiculously simple problem to show you the
pipeline of reading the problem statement, designing an algorithm, im-
plementing it, testing and debugging your program, and submitting it to
the grading system.

#### Input format.
Integers *a* and *b* on the same line (separated by a space).

#### Output format.
The sum of *a* and *b*.

#### Constraints. 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 9.

#### Sample.

##### Input:
```commandline
9 7
```

##### Output:
```commandline
16
```

##### Time limits 1 sec.

##### Memory limit. 512 Mb.

##### Text from Coursera:
*In this very first programming challenge, your goal is to implement a program that reads two digits from the standard input
and prints their sum to the standard output. We start from this simple problem to show you the pipeline of submitting a
solution to the grading system. In particular, the folder week1_programming_challenges/1_sum_of_two_digits in the following
archive file contains solutions to this problem in various programming languages. Select the solution in your favourite
programming language and submit it under the "My submission" tab. More details on the submission process are given in
Sum of Two Digits section of the file week1_programming_challenges/week1_programming_challenges.pdf in the same archive file.*

*The archive file with all the statements and starters is available from a separate page
(that can be found at the left pane under Resources):* https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/resources/3r3Mv

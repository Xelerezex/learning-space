# Second Occurrence

#### Summary

Write a program that finds the second occurrence of character 'f' inside a string, and prints the index of it. If 'f' was found only once, it should print `-1`, and if 'f' was not found, it should print -2.

#### Examples

 stdin  |   stdout
------- | ----------
comfort	| -1
coffee	| 3
car	    | -2
